# Discription of examples
In this "examples" directory, we provide a toy example to play with our fixed_seat_model.py.

The input file is "example_all_coordinates.xlsx" under this directory, which is a modified layout of Clough 152 mentioned in 
the "insights" directory". For this example, we consider all preventions (instructor, doors, aisles) for the seating arrangement. Therefore, the input file include:
* **(x,y) coordinates of all seats**
* **(x,y) coordinate of the instructor**: If you do not consider the movement of the instructor, this can be useful. In this example, we consider the movement of the instructor.
* **(x,y) coordinates of all doors**
* **(x,y) coordinates of all aisles**
