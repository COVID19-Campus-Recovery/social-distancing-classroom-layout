# social-distancing-classroom-layout
A repository with code to design socially-distanced classroom layouts. 

This repository includes the following folders:
* **Documentation**: documentation of how to convert a classroom's seating layout into an appropriate input file and run the code. The documentation also describes what the output files look like and how to visualize them.
* **Code**: The actual code needed to generate socially-distanced classroom layouts
* **Examples**: Example input files and output files for selected classrooms. These can be used to make sure you are correctly running the code.
* **Insights**: A folder with summaries of our findings so far.
